Question4: Are there significant differences in average delays/volume across the three airports and seasons?

-   **Hypothesis for Average Delays**:

    -   Null (H0): There are no significant differences in mean average delays across airports, seasons, or their interaction.

    -   Alternative (Ha1): There are significant differences in mean average delays for at least one airport, season, or their interaction.

-   **Hypothesis for Flight Volume**:

    -   Null (H0): There are no significant differences in flight volume across airports, seasons, or their interaction.

    -   Alternative (Ha2): There are significant differences in flight volume for at least one airport, season, or their interaction.
